As I type this from my tablet, I'm dumbfounded by its ability to work like this. Although it is clunky in its current iteration, it is still nonetheless working. A feat which is deserving of its own moon-landing astonishment, however that may be a subjective view.

Let me convince you. Here I am laying in bed with my back against the headrest, typing on an apple wireless keyboard which is paired via Bluetooth to an iPad mini. On that iPad I have CodeHub open (which is an unnecessary step as I think about it), which has my blog's GitHub repository open, and that is where my inputs are going. It may indeed just be me, but I find this fascinating. How all the small working parts are coming together as a whole. I should say that I've also been an adamant believer in the digital-nomad lifestyle as a lifestyle of the future. 

Fine tuning of the blog will still have to take place on a desktop, although it could take place here, it might not work for my rudimentary skills.

At the end of all of this, at least this keyboard has found a new home.
