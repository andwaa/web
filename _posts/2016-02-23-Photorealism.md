Being able to discern the physical quality of an object only through photos is a key skill to have in this age of Kickstarter knock-offs and gofundme gnomes. After perusing Kickstarter today, I found some lovely and local projects looking for funding. Like the seemingly sincere [Maladymals](http://kck.st/1Xd37Rv), and the super-polished [Lehft Watches](http://kck.st/1KjWj2v). 

Both of these projects take on authenticity in a different way. The author has portrayed himself as a person who doesn't like to be on camera - and this is visible, however in a world with staged viral videos and other shock-value hoaxes, I'm sure he could have been acting. I would like to believe that he wasn't, given the subject matter and other cues from the video, I believe he was being sincere. The watch on the other hand, since it is a physical, mass produced item rather than the thoughts and ideas of an author, has to be placed under more scrutiny. There have been countless more frauds of the physical variety than there have been of the intellectual. I find this is the case because people are increasing their ability to photoshop and render absolutely beautiful images. They present such a pristine veneer and with an appropriately priced product, the pledger can't believe their luck. But when the product finally ships - if it ever does - expectations decimate the reality of the poor craftsmanship. 

That's why I've starred both of these projects. My thinking here is that I'll have a clearer mind free from the initial hype of striking gold. Both have at least a week left on their schedule and that should offer plenty of thinking time. I'm fairly certain that I'll be backing the book, the watch however might be a stretch goal.
