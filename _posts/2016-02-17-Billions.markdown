[Billions](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270492). That's the new show from Showtime with an impressive cast featuring Paul Giamatti, Damian Lewis (who I have an unknown issue with), Maggie Siff (who I have an unknown attraction for), and Malin Akerman. At three episodes deep, I see this as a mix between [Suits](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632701) and [Silicon Valley](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988). While it is more drama heavy than the two inspirations, there are definitely some moments I found myself laughing (usually out of incredulity). The cast is fairly unknown besides the main four, but I find it that everyone pulls their own weight. I hope I see some of the actors in smaller roles in something else in the future. 

I'm going to keep watching this. Onto episode four!
